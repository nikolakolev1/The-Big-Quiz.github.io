# Quick Access to Important Files

The dashboard includes a "Quick Access to Important Files" section that displays helpful links and resources.

## Customizing Quick Access Items

To customize the items shown in the Quick Access section, edit the `renderQuickAccess()` function in `index.html` (around line 820).

The `quickAccessItems` array accepts objects with these properties:
- `type`: Either `'link'` or `'photo'`
- `name`: Display name for the item
- `url`: Target URL (external link or path to file)
- `icon`: (optional) Emoji icon for links (default: üîó)
- `thumbnail`: (optional) Thumbnail image path for photos

### Example:

```javascript
const quickAccessItems = [
  { type: 'link', name: 'The Big Quiz @ The Academy', url: 'https://www.facebook.com/TheBigQuizUK', icon: 'üîó' },
  { type: 'link', name: 'Quiz Rules & Format', url: 'https://www.thebigquiz.co.uk/', icon: 'üìã' },
  { type: 'photo', name: 'Team Photo Album', url: 'photos/2025-10-20/IMG_2821.jpeg', thumbnail: 'photos/2025-10-20/IMG_2821.jpeg' }
];
```

**Notes:**
- All items are directly clickable (no separate "Open" button)
- External links open in a new tab with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Photos can be relative paths or absolute URLs
- The section is automatically responsive and compact

# Photos per quiz ‚Äî how to add

You can attach photos to each quiz by adding a Photos column in your season CSV and placing the image files in your repo.

## 1) Put images in the repo
- Create a folder like `photos/2025-10-06/` and drop your images there.
- You can organize per date or all in one folder ‚Äî it's up to you. Use web‚Äëfriendly sizes (under ~2‚Äì3 MB per file).

## 2) Reference them from CSV
Add a new column to `data/season-YYYY.csv` named `Photos` (case‚Äëinsensitive). For each row you can use: Semicolon or pipe separated list: `photos/2025-10-06/img1.jpg; photos/2025-10-06/img2.jpg`

Example:

```
Date,Notes,Points,Teams,Photos
2025-10-06,General Knowledge,4,18,photos/2025-10-06/1.jpg; photos/2025-10-06/2.jpg
```

Note: Paths are interpreted relative to the site root. For GitHub Pages, make sure the files are committed under the repo.

## 3) View in the site
- Thumbnails render under each quiz in the "Quiz History" list.
- Click any thumbnail to open a lightbox. Use arrow keys or on‚Äëscreen arrows to navigate. Press Escape or click outside to close.
